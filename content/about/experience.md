I’m Holly Hilliard from Hillsboro, Ohio, and I appreciate alliteration. I also love birds. And cats.

I grew up in a town of 6,000 or so people in the Appalachian foothills. The cool kids were very into football, but I preferred choir, concert band, and reading books about dragons. I attended Duke University and surprised everyone by choosing to camp out in K-Ville for basketball tickets pretty much every spring. 

I was an intern at One Story magazine and at Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill before working as an assistant at a literary agency in NYC. I left publishing to work in legal operations, but I couldn’t stay away from the book world for long: in 2019, I graduated with an MFA in Creative Writing from North Carolina State University, where I completed a short story collection and taught fiction workshops for undergrads. 

Now, I’m hard at work on a YA novel set in the Blue Ridge Mountains. When I’m not writing, I’m birding! I have many favorite birds, but today it’s the sandhill crane. Did you know the oldest confirmed sandhill crane fossil was found in Florida and estimated to be 2.5 million years old?
